Collaborative Finance (CoFi) is a set of monetary and financiel instruments that tap into the value created by economic communities through a balance of  collaboration and market competition in the real economy. On GitHub, it is an intangible common good infrastructure which aims to become the go-to library for people and communities anywhere to access, edit, improve, remix, redistribute, deploy, and maintain to create and implement financial primitives for the benefit of their economic networks.
